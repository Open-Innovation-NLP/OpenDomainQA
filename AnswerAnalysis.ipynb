In the spring when I am restocking everything before my busy season I often max my card and have to pay it off half way through the month.  This can actually safe your score depending on when they pull the amount owned\\n\\nWhat really matters is your credit history.  Your credit score is based off of items including:\\n\\n- Average age of credit.  So when you open a new card and if you one other debt that is 4yrs old, bam you now have an average credit age of 2yrs and your score dropped 20 points or so.\\n\\n- Mix of credit.   They want to see a mix of various loans, credit cards, lines if credit, etc.  Of course every time you add a new souce of debt/credit this lowers your average age is credit.\\n\\n- Overall credit usage.   As others have said your credit score is a measure of how much risk giving you a loan or a cc is.  Higher your score, less risk to the bank.  So if you often have 80% plus usage of your credit cards max balance this is a warning sign to them.   Amount of debt on your cc is usually pulled from your bill.   This one has bit me in the butt before since my business credit card has a MUCH higher _URL_0_ than my personal.   This is also why it may be a good idea to keep older cards that you rarely use.  It adds to your overall available cc pool.  So many experts will recommend keeping that old card with no annual fees and using it couple times a year.  Also cancelling old card can affect your average age I'd credit.\\n\\n- Payment history.  Banks was to see good payment history obviously.  Making late parents on anything that reports to a credit bureau can lower your credit score.\\n\\n- And finally we have derogatory remarks.   If you really screw up or piss off a financial institution that can leave a note on your credit report explaining​ how you screwed up.  These can be very bad for your credit score.\\n\\nI believe those 5 are majors things the different credit bureaus look at.   Also each credit bureau focuses on different types of debt. ( I don't think my home loan shows up on one of them, just my auto and cc). And each one is going to weight these metrics slightly differently. \\n\\n\\nEdit:. TLDR Credit I'd based on age, mix, usage, good payment history, and not getting angry notes from banks.\\n\\nSources: Researching my own credit score and trying to improve it from nothing to something I can get good business loans and a decent business cc with.

Refrigerated eggs (in their carton and not in the door) can still be used for 3 to 5 weeks after that date.\\n\\nA “Use-by” or “Best-by” date is a recommendation for best flavor or quality. These are normally found on shelf-stable products such as canned or boxed goods or condiments.  It is not a safety issue. Foods age in different ways. Frozen meat will not become unsafe to eat if it is kept frozen.  That doesn’t mean it won’t change.  Freezer burn will affect the quality and texture of the meat and make it unpalatable.  Foods such as cookies and crackers will also be affected by time.  The fat in the cookie will react with oxygen and become rancid and crackers will absorb moisture out of the air and become stale.  They will taste off, but will not make you sick.\\n\\nAn “Expires On” date is about safety.  Only a small group of foods have expiration dates. Infant formula and some baby foods are required by Federal regulations to have an expiration date.  Other foods that should have an expiration date will be ready-to-eat foods such as deli items and prepared sandwiches. These foods may contain harmful bacteria and are not cooked before they are eaten.\\n\\nExpiration dates are about safety.  Best by dates are about taste, texture and appearance.\"</td>\n",

If it smells horrible, it's expired and you WILL get sick from consuming it.\\n\\nSell by dates signify the date at which the food should be sold from wherever is selling it to the consumer: supermarkets, convenience stores, etc. These are not as common as best before and use by dates.\\n\\nThe reason foods have different dates is because they do different things with age:\\n\\nSome foods, like flour and honey, NEVER expire, so fall into the best before category. Food in this category can usually be eaten safely after expiry.\\n\\nOther foods are given use by dates if they perish quickly and can be unsafe after the expiry, such as milk and other dairy.

It's your main source of income. If I start spreading rumours that you were arrested for molesting a kid, even though that is false, and the rumours take hold, say goodbye to your business.

The thing is, truth is generally a complete defence to this kind of lawsuit. If the contents if the review are true (e.g. the food really was cold when it arrived, etc) then it seems like there would be no valid claim.

The weight of the object is supported by the magnets which would still measure the same weight overall.   \n",

       "273  As others have said, that approach will not change your credit much.   I do it all the time with my business credit card.  In the spring when I am restocking everything before my busy season I often max my card and have to pay it off half way through the month.  This can actually safe your score depending on when they pull the amount owned\\n\\nWhat really matters is your credit history.  Your credit score is based off of items including:\\n\\n- Average age of credit.  So when you open a new card and if you one other debt that is 4yrs old, bam you now have an average credit age of 2yrs and your score dropped 20 points or so.\\n\\n- Mix of credit.   They want to see a mix of various loans, credit cards, lines if credit, etc.  Of course every time you add a new souce of debt/credit this lowers your average age is credit.\\n\\n- Overall credit usage.   As others have said your credit score is a measure of how much risk giving you a loan or a cc is.  Higher your score, less risk to the bank.  So if you often have 80% plus usage of your credit cards max balance this is a warning sign to them.   Amount of debt on your cc is usually pulled from your bill.   This one has bit me in the butt before since my business credit card has a MUCH higher _URL_0_ than my personal.   This is also why it may be a good idea to keep older cards that you rarely use.  It adds to your overall available cc pool.  So many experts will recommend keeping that old card with no annual fees and using it couple times a year.  Also cancelling old card can affect your average age I'd credit.\\n\\n- Payment history.  Banks was to see good payment history obviously.  Making late parents on anything that reports to a credit bureau can lower your credit score.\\n\\n- And finally we have derogatory remarks.   If you really screw up or piss off a financial institution that can leave a note on your credit report explaining​ how you screwed up.  These can be very bad for your credit score.\\n\\nI believe those 5 are majors things the different credit bureaus look at.   Also each credit bureau focuses on different types of debt. ( I don't think my home loan shows up on one of them, just my auto and cc). And each one is going to weight these metrics slightly differently. \\n\\n\\nEdit:. TLDR Credit I'd based on age, mix, usage, good payment history, and not getting angry notes from banks.\\n\\nSources: Researching my own credit score and trying to improve it from nothing to something I can get good business loans and a decent business cc with.   Running a business is hard enough with no credit score.   \n",

Refrigerated eggs (in their carton and not in the door) can still be used for 3 to 5 weeks after that date.\\n\\nA “Use-by” or “Best-by” date is a recommendation for best flavor or quality. These are normally found on shelf-stable products such as canned or boxed goods or condiments.  It is not a safety issue. Foods age in different ways. Frozen meat will not become unsafe to eat if it is kept frozen.  That doesn’t mean it won’t change.  Freezer burn will affect the quality and texture of the meat and make it unpalatable.  Foods such as cookies and crackers will also be affected by time.  The fat in the cookie will react with oxygen and become rancid and crackers will absorb moisture out of the air and become stale.  They will taste off, but will not make you sick.\\n\\nAn “Expires On” date is about safety.  Only a small group of foods have expiration dates. Infant formula and some baby foods are required by Federal regulations to have an expiration date.  Other foods that should have an expiration date will be ready-to-eat foods such as deli items and prepared sandwiches. These foods may contain harmful bacteria and are not cooked before they are eaten.\\n\\nExpiration dates are about safety.  Best by dates are about taste, texture and appearance.\"   \n",

Here in wisconsin, we use a shit ton of salt, and it actually can help some plants like celery grow. Apparently there are people here that drive around in spring and get some road celery to eat? Idk why but I've seen it happen.   \n",

Metro NY simply lacks the space for stadiums, practice fields, training facilities, and tailgating space. \\n\\nNext think of culture. NYC is a more transient population with more social groups / clichés for people to associate with. Compare to someplace like Oklahoma where there is more opportunity for the population to be life long fans. Plus, the schools in NY have a different culture than most blue blood campuses (most blue blood have more district campuses to start with rather than blending into the community and ease of access to the rest of the city)\\n\\nThird: competition. New York Metro has two NFL teams and plenty of other major league sports. Alabama doesn't even have one NFL. There is only so much time in the week to dedicate top watching football and emotional investment to give to football. It dilutes the news coverage.   \n",

Rainbow is what happens when you split white light into its basic components.\\n\\nWhen you mix paint, you take away colours from basic of the white of the paper (or whatever lamp you shine). Red crayon blocks all of the green and blue light, reflecting only red. Green crayon blocks all of the blue and red light. Yellow crayon blocks all the blue light.Mix all the blockers and you get black.   \n",

First it wouldn't make sense in a philosophical way. Second, the homogeneity of the universe, and the fact that it's expending *everywhere* at the same time, shows that there's no center in the universe.\\n\\nTake these observations together and it's obvious that there's a large part of the universe that we cannot see. If the entire universe was the observable universe, we'd have to be in the center and that's absurd.\\n\\nThe open question is whether the universe is finite or infinite. Both are equally plausible.   \n",

You think that taste is the reason why your mouth burns when you eat spicy food, but in reality the cause is a chemical called capsaicin. This chemical is the one released by your body to tell your brain when you get burn. So, why do we feel like we are burning when we eat peppers? well, capsaicin its naturally found in various amounts in peppers. That is the reason why \"pepper\" spray burns your eyes when in reality it doesn't physically burn you. So, the reason your \"but hole\" burns its because traces of this chemical remain after the food is processed.   \n",

You first look where you think it should be, then you look a little to the side to actually view the object. I've become quite good at it and now look at most stars indirectly.\\n\\nEdit: Here's some additional info for people who want to know why this is. You have two types of cells in your eyes. Cones that are designed to detect color (three types) and rods that only detect brightness levels across a wide color range. Your brain mixes those two signals together to give you what you see. It's most important to see color in the center of your vision though so your eye has a concentration of those cones in the center of your vision and you detect color less well outside the center of your vision. This is also why when its dark everything seems to become black and white because the cones in the center of your vision can hardly see any light any more. (Think walking around with a dim night light, or when you wake up in the middle of the night without any lights on but can still see because of various dim sources of light.) The center of your eye has more cones than rods while the periphery of your eye has more rods than cones. Coincidentally, rods see best in the blue/green color range which is why you use red light to not destroy your dark vision as the rods don't see the red very well.   \n",

In other words, most of the cost of a chip is the machine that makes all the chips not the individual components of a single chip.\\n\\nThe technology to make chips smaller and faster keeps improving by doubling about 18 months so the value of the chips made by the machines built 18 months ago is forced to decline.\\n\\nMaking the smallest, fastest chips is the most expensive part of the industry.  But the machines to make larger, slower chips are still working (until they so become obsolete nobody has any reason to buy what they can produce and they're scrapped).  That means that the price of a given performance level always declines over time.\\n\\nIf the price between \"smallest/fastest\" and \"previous smallest/fastest\" becomes too great, consumers will just opt for the previous generation.  That puts an upper limit on what chipmakers can charge for the current generation.  That limit has remained essentially unchanged since the 1970s.  You pay about as much for the highest-end intel CPU today as you would have paid for the highest-end chip in the 70s.  But today's chips have doubled in speed and density every 18 months for 40 years so they're billions of times better.   \n",

If you're on a plane, traveling at 400mph, and you walk 3mph toward the front of the plane up the aisle you're moving at 403mph. You can't do that on a space ship going light speed (which is impossible anyway), but I'm not sure what would happen. I recommend watching the original cosmos series by Carl Sagan, he does a whole thing on the weirdness of light speed   \n",

Most of it doesn't look like Feminism to you because you have a preconception of what 'Feminist' means. [Malala Yousafzai] (_URL_1_) is a 'feminist' fighting for greater rights of women in this gross over-simplification of world politics you have commented on. To a Western with a preconception of what 'Feminist' means, it looks like angry white women with short hair burning thing?\\n\\nFeminism is a young girl daring an entire culture to deny her a right to education. Feminism is the entire continent of India having a discussion about the rights of women in the course of sexual assault. \\n\\nJust because you don't see it, doesn't mean it's not there. I don't know if you actually know what feminism looks like.   \n",

Active materials can range anywhere from solids like crystals (ruby and sapphire are common active materials in lasers, albeit not usually handheld laser pointers), to gases and ionic plasmas. \\n\\n\\nSome active materials lase 'better' (at higher output powers) than others. Typically red (~671 nm) laser pointers are laser diodes, which lase due to semiconductor diodes very similar to the way LED lights work. The maximum output power of this material is often only around 1-50mW. By contrast, green or green-blue lasers are built using a myriad of lasing materials (a common active material is neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet or Nd:YAG for short) that can output powers in the 100-500mW range. More power = more photons to be scattered = better sight of the beam.   \n",

But the State Prosecutor brings criminal charges and it only tangentially involves the victim of the crime. Committing a crime is an offense against the state and the state will hold the perpetrator accountable. The victim cannot \"drop charges\" because they didn't bring them.   \n",

But if you just throw some ice cubes in a glass of water then they'll float, and won't be totally submerged.   \n",

Banks will turn them in for new bills and the number in circulation drops off into non-existence.\\n\\nSo even though a circa 1940 dollar is still legal tender and to be accepted, seeing someone show up in your town with a stack of crisp, new bills of that style is super suspicious. Even faked aging isn't going to make it fly under the radar.   \n",

First picture the space shuttle on a launch pad. It's attached to the big red rocket which also has 2 white booster rockets attached to it. All three of those rockets are just to get the shuttle up to speed to stay in orbit. If you want to slow the shuttle back down you are going to need the same amount of fuel so double the rocket count. Now rockets are heavy and since you are saving those extra rockets for slowing down, you won't be using them on the way up so you need more rockets to lift the slowing down rockets. With out doing any math, lets just estimate a third set of rockets. \\n\\nSo now you have tripled the fuel cost and tripled the risk of a rocket failing just to avoid a fiery reentry. Or you can avoid all of that and just let the air slow you down.   \n",

However, there is another force pushing against the pull of gravity from the Earth. The object has weight but is stopped from being pulled towards the center or gravity. An analogy, but not a direct comparison, would be leaning into the wind. While you have the same weight, you are stopped from falling by an opposite force. Same idea, different force acting on the object.   \n",

That's just not how it works.  \\n\\nSustained history of regular use, and paying the bill in full each month will slowly but surely build your credit, and won't cost you a dime. \\n\\nGet yourself a credit card, and set a couple of regular bills (cell phone, maybe a utility) to auto-pay from the card.  Then set the card to pay it's balance in full each month.  Then forget about it.  Check your score in 6 months, and you'll be very pleased with what you see (assuming that you've got no debts in collections, or anything else that hurts credit).   \n",

       "276             The different dates on foods in the UK are best before, use by and sometimes sell by dates, so I'll explain those.\\n\\nBest before dates signify the date at which the food would taste the best beforehand. However, this doesn't mean the food has expired after this date, it is still perfectly fine after this (obviously, depending on what it is). Some things that have best before dates are plain flour (which NEVER expires), honey (also never expires) and eggs (suprisingly, although I assume it's because the animal is vaccinated.)\\n\\nUse by dates signify the date at which the food MUST be eaten to prevent sickness. Obviously, sickness isn't guaranteed. Your best bet is to smell the food/drink if it is dairy (such as milk). If it smells horrible, it's expired and you WILL get sick from consuming it.\\n\\nSell by dates signify the date at which the food should be sold from wherever is selling it to the consumer: supermarkets, convenience stores, etc. These are not as common as best before and use by dates.\\n\\nThe reason foods have different dates is because they do different things with age:\\n\\nSome foods, like flour and honey, NEVER expire, so fall into the best before category. Food in this category can usually be eaten safely after expiry.\\n\\nOther foods are given use by dates if they perish quickly and can be unsafe after the expiry, such as milk and other dairy. If not, the food falls into the best before category.\\n\\nFoods with sell by are just guiding the shop when it is best to sell them by, and behaves like a best before date.   \n",

The price actually are partly fixed costs (which are named that way because you can't alter them by the amount you produce, they guy operating a machine for 8 hours costs the same, doesn't matter if he produces 10 or 1000 things of something) the other part would be variable costs, higher or lower prices for the material would be one of them, and even here its only a fraction of it.  \\n\\nTo sum this point up: When you are running a bakery, having flour prices drop by 50% won't make your cake-prices drop by 50%  \\n\\n- You need gasoline.

Most of New York's population is centered around NYC and Long Island. New York City is largely diverse, bringing in people from all over the world. Many other parts of the world value soccer over football, and they carry over their views and preferences to here. Lack of interest leads to lack of people trying for the teams.\\n\\nAs a New Yorker (Long Islander specifically), we don't value football as much as other states. We prefer baseball and basketball (to a lesser extent) as our viewing sport most of the time (the 'Mets or Yankees' question is especially serious in my area), and depending on the region, lacrosse is viewed as bigger than football.   \n",

The universe is expanding at an *increasing* rate of speed, and some faraway parts of the observable universe will someday be moving away from us at greater than the speed of light (because space is expanding, not because those galaxies can travel faster than *c*). We can never travel fast enough to reach these places, and even light from them can’t reach us because they’re moving away too fast. In effect, they don’t exist for us - they’re outside our observable universe.\\n\\nAnd because the universe is expanding faster and faster, more and more of it will become inaccessible. It’s plausible that eventually, our own galaxy might be the entire universe that’s observable to us. Future generations won’t know how full the universe is, unless our current knowledge survives the eons - and even then they’ll have to take it on faith because they won’t be able to verify our claims.   \n",

What? I have never ever noticed this. I am in a extremely dark area where you can see the milky way really clearly at the night. I spent a lot of time looking at stars and always felt like I see more if I look directly at the stars in question. \\n\\nWhile the explanation makes sense in practice I haven't noticed this at all   \n",

There's backups and redundancy as things are held in multiple centers, and you have to build the facilitates, but its not that hard to keep ahead of the wave when you're already established.   \n",

In the days of kings, the Holy See was seen as a neutral third party who could broker peace, especially by doing so in the name of God.  \\n\\nFrom time-to-time the Holy See has been government of physical territory, such as the Papal States and the Vatican City.  That doesn't matter though, because the Holy See isn't asserting its right to be heard as a State, it's asserting its right to be heard as God's diplomat.\\n\\nIf this seems absurd, hold on, because diplomacy gets weirder. The Holy See is merely the oldest non-state to have diplomats.  Other entities such as the Red Cross, the International Olympic Committee, and the super-bizarre Sovereign Military Order of Malta all have foreign relations despite not having a population or territory.\\n\\nSince the founding of the UN and our modern era of public treaties, these organizations have \"observer status.\"  They can't vote, and they're not invited to anything truly important, like nuclear arms treaties.  They're a vestige of ancient times, but they still present interesting public relations, economic stimulus, peace advocacy missions, and humanitarian causes. Although that may be strange it isn't necessarily bad.   \n",

One way would require you to have propellant to slow your orbital velocity way down, instead of using the atmosphere to do it and then to counter act the force of gravity pulling you down. It's just wasteful to do it that way over shielding and gliding to a landing (or parachutes after a certain altitude)   \n",

       "298  Lawyer here. I will do the best to try to explain simply.\\n\\nThere are three main reasons you can sue someone. Either they broke a contract with you, they interfered with (or stole) your property, or they have committed a wrong, called a \"tort\", against you. This kind of lawsuit is in the third category.\\n\\nOne tort in many places is called defamation. You may also have heard the terms libel and slander. The rough idea with these torts is that if you say something false about someone, that harms their reputation, you owe them compensation.\\n\\nFor example, let's say you run a daycare in your home. It's your main source of income. If I start spreading rumours that you were arrested for molesting a kid, even though that is false, and the rumours take hold, say goodbye to your business. Now I have wronged you, destroyed your reputation in the community, and harmed you financially. I should owe you compensation for what I've done. So you can sue me.\\n\\nIn the context of internet reviews, it's possible that a negative review could harm a business' reputation and cost it money. So a business could sue. The thing is, truth is generally a complete defence to this kind of lawsuit. If the contents if the review are true (e.g. the food really was cold when it arrived, etc) then it seems like there would be no valid claim. The problem is that internet reviews sometimes stray into hyperbole, which potentially opens the door for a lawsuit.\\n\\nJust to be clear, I'm not giving anyone legal advice here. I'm talking about a generic, hypothetical situation.   \n",

So when you touch metal, it does a really good job of conducting the heat in your hand into the metal itself - this means lots of heat is drawn out of your hand, making your hand feel colder.\\n\\nIf you touch something that's not as good at conducting heat, like wood, you're not going to feel that sensation, even if the wood and the metal are the same temperature (let's say room temp).  Your hand tells what's cold and what's not by how much heat is leeched away when it touches something, and metal does better than a lot of other objects.   \n",

Expiration dates are the date at which the product no longer meets the FDA's standards for safe consumption.

      "Miranda warning Origin and development of Miranda rights The concept of \"Miranda rights\" was enshrined in U.S. law following the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona Supreme Court decision, which found that the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights of Ernesto Arturo Miranda had been violated during his arrest and trial for armed robbery, kidnapping, and rape of a mentally handicapped young woman. \n",
      "Miranda was subsequently retried and convicted, based primarily on his estranged ex-partner, who had been tracked down by the original arresting officer via Miranda's own parents, suddenly claiming that Miranda had confessed to her when she had visited him in\n",
      "jail; Miranda's lawyer later confessed that he 'goofed' the trial.\n",
      "The circumstances triggering the Miranda safeguards, i.e. Miranda rights, are \"custody\" and \"interrogation\". Custody means formal arrest or the deprivation of freedom to an extent associated with formal arrest. Interrogation means explicit questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. The Supreme Court did not specify the exact wording to use when informing a suspect of their rights. However, the Court did create a set of guidelines that must be followed. The ruling states:\n",
      "...The person in custody must, prior to interrogation, be clearly informed that he/she has\n",
      "the right to remain silent, and that anything the person says will be used against that person in court; the person must be clearly informed that he/she has the right to consult with an attorney and to have that attorney present during questioning, and that, if he/she is indigent, an attorney will be provided at no cost to represent him/her.\n",
      "In Berkemer v. McCarty (1984), the Supreme Court decided that a person subjected to custodial interrogation is entitled to the benefit of the procedural safeguards enunciated in Miranda, regardless of the nature or severity of the offense of which they are\n",
      "suspected or for which they were arrested.\n",
      "As a result, American English developed the verb Mirandize, meaning \"read the Miranda rights to\" a suspect (when the suspect is arrested).\n",
      "Notably, the Miranda rights do not have to be read in any particular order, and they do not have to precisely match the language of the Miranda case as long as they are adequately and fully conveyed (California v. Prysock, 453 U.S. 355 (1981)).\n",
      "In Berghuis v. Thompkins (2010), the Supreme Court held that unless a suspect expressly states that they are invoking this right, subsequent voluntary statements made to an officer can be\n",
      "used against them in court, and police can continue to interact with (or question) the alleged criminal. Circumstances triggering the Miranda requisites The circumstances triggering the Miranda safeguards, i.e. Miranda warnings, are \"custody\" and \"interrogation\". Custody means formal arrest or the deprivation of freedom to an extent associated with formal arrest. Interrogation means explicit questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. Suspects in \"custody\" who are about to be interrogated must be properly advised of their Miranda rights—namely, the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self incrimination (and, in furtherance of this right, the right to\n",
      "counsel while in custody). The Sixth Amendment right to counsel means that the suspect has the right to consult with an attorney before questioning begins and have an attorney present during the interrogation. The Fifth Amendment right against compelled self incrimination is the right to remain silent—the right to refuse to answer questions or to otherwise communicate information.\n",
      "The duty to warn only arises when police officers conduct custodial interrogations. The Constitution does not require that a defendant be advised of the Miranda rights as part of the arrest procedure, or once an officer has probable cause to arrest, or if\n",
      "the defendant has become a suspect of the focus of an investigation. Custody and interrogation are the events that trigger the duty to warn. Use in various U.S. state jurisdictions Some jurisdictions provide the right of a juvenile to remain silent if their parent or guardian is not present. Some departments in New Jersey, Nevada, Oklahoma, and Alaska modify the \"providing an attorney\" clause as follows:\n",
      "We have no way of giving you a lawyer, but one will be appointed for you, if you wish, if and when you go to court.\n",
      "Even though this sentence may be somewhat ambiguous to some\n",
      "laypersons, who can, and who have actually interpreted it as meaning that they will not get a lawyer until they confess and are arraigned in court, the U.S. Supreme Court has approved of it as an accurate description of the procedure in those states.\n",
      "In states bordering Mexico, including Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California, suspects who are not United States citizens are given an additional warning:\n",
      "If you are not a United States citizen, you may contact your country's consulate prior to any questioning.\n",
      "Some states including Virginia require the following sentence, ensuring that the suspect knows that waiving Miranda rights is\n",
      "not a one-time absolute occurrence:\n",
      "You can decide at any time from this moment on to terminate the interview and exercise these rights.\n",
      "California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Washington and Pennsylvania also add the following questions, presumably to comply with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations:\n",
      "Question 1: Do you understand each of these rights I have explained to you?\n",
      "Question 2: Having these rights in mind, do you wish to talk to us now?\n",
      "An affirmative answer to both of the above questions waives the rights. If the suspect responds \"no\" to the first question, the officer is\n",
      "required to re-read the Miranda warning, while saying \"no\" to the second question invokes the right at that moment; in either case the interviewing officer or officers cannot question the suspect until the rights are waived.\n",
      "Generally, when defendants invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refuse to testify or submit to cross-examination at trial, the prosecutor cannot indirectly punish them for the exercise of a constitutional right by commenting on their silence and insinuating that it is an implicit admission of guilt. Since Miranda rights are simply a judicial gloss upon the Fifth Amendment which protects against coercive interrogations,\n",
      "the same rule also prevents prosecutors from commenting about the post-arrest silence of suspects who invoke their Miranda rights immediately after arrest. However, neither the Fifth Amendment nor Miranda extend to pre-arrest silence, which means that if a defendant takes the witness stand at trial (meaning he just waived his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent), the prosecutor can attack his credibility with his pre-arrest silence (based on his failure to immediately turn himself in and confess to the things he voluntarily testified about at trial).\n",
      "Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Article 31 provides for the right against compelled\n",
      "self-incrimination. Interrogation subjects under Army jurisdiction must first be given Department of the Army Form 3881, which informs them of the charges and their rights, and the subjects must sign the form. The United States Navy and United States Marine Corps require that all arrested personnel be read the \"rights of the accused\" and must sign a form waiving those rights if they so desire; a verbal waiver is not sufficient.\n",
      "It has been discussed whether a Miranda warning—if spoken or in writing—could be appropriately given to disabled persons. For example, \"the right to remain silent\" means little to a deaf\n",
      "individual and the word \"constitutional\" may not be understood by people with only an elementary education. In one case, a deaf murder suspect was kept at a therapy station until he was able to understand the meaning of the Miranda warning and other judicial proceedings. Assertion If the defendant asserts his right to remain silent all interrogation must immediately stop and the police may not resume the interrogation unless they have \"scrupulously honored\" the defendant's assertion and subsequently obtained a valid waiver before resuming the interrogation. In determining whether the police \"scrupulously honored\" the assertion the courts apply a totality\n",
      "of the circumstances test. The most important factors are the length of time between termination of the original interrogation and the commencement of the second, and issuing a new set of Miranda warnings before resumption of interrogation.\n",
      "The consequences of assertion of Sixth Amendment right to counsel are stricter. The police must immediately cease all interrogation and the police cannot reinitiate interrogation unless counsel is present (merely consulting with counsel is insufficient) or the defendant of his own volition contacts the police. If the defendant does reinitiate contact, a valid waiver must be obtained before interrogation may resume.\n",
      "In Berghuis v. Thompkins\n",
      "(2010), the Supreme Court declared in a 5–4 decision that criminal defendants who have been read their Miranda rights (and who have indicated they understand them and have not already waived them), must explicitly state during or before an interrogation begins that they wish to be silent and not speak to police for that protection against self-incrimination to apply. If they speak to police about the incident before invoking the Miranda right to remain silent, or afterwards at any point during the interrogation or detention, the words they speak may be used against them if they have not stated they\n",
      "do not want to speak to police. Those who oppose the ruling contend that the requirement that the defendant must speak to indicate his intention to remain silent further erodes the ability of the defendant to stay completely silent about the case. This opposition must be put in context with the second option offered by the majority opinion, which allowed that the defendant had the option of remaining silent, saying: \"Had he wanted to remain silent, he could have said nothing in response or unambiguously invoked his Miranda rights, ending the interrogation.\" Thus, having been \"Mirandized\", a suspect may avow\n",
      "explicitly the invocation of these rights, or, alternatively, simply remain silent. Absent the former, \"anything [said] can and will be used against [the defendant] in a court of law\". Public safety exception The \"public safety\" exception is a limited and case-specific exception, allowing certain unadvised statements (given without Miranda warnings) to be admissible into evidence at trial when they were elicited in circumstances where there was great danger to public safety; thus, the Miranda rule provides some elasticity.\n",
      "The public safety exception derives from New York v. Quarles (1984), a case in which the Supreme Court considered the admissibility of a\n",
      "statement elicited by a police officer who apprehended a rape suspect who was thought to be carrying a firearm. The arrest took place during the middle of the night in a supermarket that was open to the public but apparently deserted except for the clerks at the checkout counter. When the officer arrested the suspect, he found an empty shoulder holster, handcuffed the suspect, and asked him where the gun was. The suspect nodded in the direction of the gun (which was near some empty cartons) and said, \"The gun is over there\". The Supreme Court found that such an\n",
      "unadvised statement was admissible in evidence because \"[i]n a kaleidoscopic situation such as the one confronting these officers, where spontaneity rather than adherence to a police manual is necessarily the order of the day, the application of the exception we recognize today should not be made to depend on post hoc findings at a suppression hearing concerning the subjective motivation of the police officer\". Thus, the jurisprudential rule of Miranda must yield in \"a situation where concern for public safety must be paramount to adherence to the literal language of the prophylactic rules enunciated in Miranda\".\n",
      "Under this exception, to be\n",
      "admissible in the government's direct case at a trial, the questioning must not be \"actually compelled by police conduct which overcame his will to resist\", and must be focused and limited, involving a situation \"in which police officers ask questions reasonably prompted by a concern for the public safety\".\n",
      "In 2010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation encouraged agents to use a broad interpretation of public safety-related questions in terrorism cases, stating that the \"magnitude and complexity\" of terrorist threats justified \"a significantly more extensive public safety interrogation without Miranda warnings than would be permissible in an ordinary criminal case\", continuing to\n",
      "list such examples as: \"questions about possible impending or coordinated terrorist attacks; the location, nature and threat posed by weapons that might pose an imminent danger to the public; and the identities, locations, and activities or intentions of accomplices who may be plotting additional imminent attacks\". A Department of Justice spokesman described this position as not altering the constitutional right, but as clarifying existing flexibility in the rule.\n",
      "Prosecutors initially argued for this exception to be applied to the 16-hour interrogation of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in connection with the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. However, the exception was not considered by the court\n",
      "because the prosecutors later decided not to use any of that evidence in their case against Tsarnaev.\n",
      "The New York Court of Appeals upheld the exception in a 2013 murder case, People v Doll, where a man with blood on his clothes was detained and questioned.\n",
      "The window of opportunity for the exception is small. Once the suspect is formally charged, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel would attach and surreptitious interrogation would be prohibited. The public safety exception applies where circumstances present a clear and present danger to the public's safety and the officers have reason to believe that the suspect\n",
      "has information that can end the emergency. Consequences of violation Assuming that a Miranda violation occurred—the six factors are present and no exception applies—the statement will be subject to suppression under the Miranda exclusionary rule. That is, if the defendant objects or files a motion to suppress, the exclusionary rule would prohibit the prosecution from offering the statement as proof of guilt. However, the statement can be used to impeach the defendant's testimony. Further, the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine does not apply to Miranda violations. Therefore, the exclusionary rule exceptions, attenuation, independent source and inevitable discovery, do not\n",
      "come into play, and derivative evidence would be fully admissible. For example, suppose the police continue with a custodial interrogation after the suspect has asserted his right to silence. During his post-assertion statement the suspect tells the police the location of the gun he used in the murder. Using this information the police find the gun. Forensic testing identifies the gun as the murder weapon, and fingerprints lifted from the gun match the suspect's. The contents of the Miranda-defective statement could not be offered by the prosecution as substantive evidence, but the gun itself and all related forensic evidence could\n",
      "be used as evidence at trial. Related doctrines In addition to Miranda, confession may be challenged under the Massiah Doctrine, the Voluntariness Standard, Provisions of Federal and State rules of criminal procedure and State Constitutional provisions. Massiah Doctrine The Massiah Doctrine (established by Massiah v. United States) prohibits the admission of a confession obtained in violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Specifically, the Massiah rule applies to the use of testimonial evidence in criminal proceedings deliberately elicited by the police from a defendant after formal charges have been filed. The events that trigger the Sixth Amendment safeguards\n",
      "under Massiah are (1) the commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings and (2) deliberate elicitation of information from the defendant by governmental agents.\n",
      "The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant a right to counsel in all criminal prosecutions. The purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel are to protect a defendant's right to a fair trial and to assure that the adversarial system of justice functions properly by providing competent counsel as an advocate for the defendant in his contest against the \"prosecutorial forces\" of the state. Commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings The Sixth Amendment right \"attaches\" once the government has committed\n",
      "itself to the prosecution of the case by the initiation of adversarial judicial proceedings \"by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information or arraignment\". Determining whether a particular event or proceeding constitutes the commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings requires both an examination of the rules of criminal procedure for the jurisdiction in which the crime is charged and the Supreme Courts cases dealing with the issue of when formal prosecution begins. Once adversarial criminal proceedings commence the right to counsel applies to all critical stages of the prosecution and investigation. A critical stage is \"any stage of the prosecution,\n",
      "formal or informal, in court or out, where counsel's absence might derogate from the accused's right to a fair trial\".\n",
      "Government attempts to obtain incriminating statement related to the offense charged from the defendant by overt interrogation or surreptitious means is a critical stage and any information thus obtained is subject to suppression unless the government can show that an attorney was present or the defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to counsel. Deliberate elicitation of information from the defendant by governmental agents Deliberate elicitation is defined as the intentional creation of circumstances by government agents that are likely\n",
      "to produce incriminating information from the defendant. Clearly express questioning (interrogation) would qualify but the concept also extends to surreptitious attempts to acquire information from the defendant through the use of undercover agents or paid informants.\n",
      "The definition of \"deliberate elicitation\" is not the same as the definition of \"interrogation\" under the Miranda rule. Miranda interrogation includes express questioning and any actions or statements that an officer would reasonably foresee as likely to cause an incriminating response. Massiah applies to express questioning and any attempt to deliberately and intentionally obtain incriminating information from the defendant regarding the crime charged. The difference\n",
      "is purposeful creation of an environment likely to produce incriminating information (Massiah) and action likely to induce an incriminating response even if that was not the officer's purpose or intent (Miranda).\n",
      "The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is offense-specific – the right only applies to post-commencement attempts to obtain information relating to the crime charged. The right does not extend to uncharged offenses if factually related to the charged crime.\n",
      "As noted, information obtained in violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel is subject to suppression unless the government can establish that the defendant waived his right to counsel. The waiver\n",
      "must be knowing, intelligent and voluntary. A valid Miranda waiver operates as a waiver of Sixth Amendment right. The voluntariness standard The voluntariness standard applies to all police interrogations regardless of the custodial status of the suspect and regardless of whether the suspect has been formally charged. The remedy for a violation of the standard is complete suppression of the statement and any evidence derived from the statement. The statement cannot be used as either substantive evidence of guilt or to impeach the defendant's testimony. The reason for the strictness is the common law's aversion to the use of coerced\n",
      "confessions because of their inherent unreliability. Further the rights to be free from coerced confession cannot be waived nor is it necessary that the victim of coercive police conduct assert his right. In considering the voluntariness standard one must consider the Supreme Court's decision in Colorado v. Connelly. Although federal courts' application of the Connelly rule has been inconsistent and state courts have often failed to appreciate the consequences of the case, Connelly clearly marked a significant change in the application of the voluntariness standard. Before Connelly the test was whether the confession was voluntary considering the totality of the\n",
      "circumstances. \"Voluntary\" carried its everyday meaning: the confession had to be a product of the exercise of the defendant's free will rather than police coercion. After Connelly the totality of circumstances test is not even triggered unless the defendant can show coercive police conduct. Questions of free will and rational decision making are irrelevant to a due process claim unless police misconduct existed and a causal connection can be shown between the misconduct and the confession. State constitutional challenges Every state constitution has articles and provision guaranteeing individual rights. In most cases the subject matter is similar to the federal\n",
      "bill of rights. Most state courts interpretation of their constitution is consistent with the interpretation federal court's of analogous provisions of the federal constitution. With regard to Miranda issues, state courts have exhibited significant resistance to incorporating into their state jurisprudence some of the limitations on the Miranda rule that have been created by the federal courts. As a consequence a defendant may be able to circumvent the federal limitation on the Miranda rule and successfully challenge the admissibility under state constitutional provisions. Practically every aspect of the Miranda rule has drawn state court criticism. However the primary point of\n",
      "contention involve the following limitations on the scope of the Miranda rule: (1) the Harris exception (2) the Burbine rule and (3) the Fare rule. State statutory challenges In addition to constitutionally based challenge, states permit a defendant to challenge the admissibility of a confession on the grounds that the confession was obtained in violation of a defendant's statutory rights. For example, North Carolina Criminal Procedure Act permits a defendant to move to suppress evidence obtained as a result of a \"substantial\" violation of the provision of the North Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure. Confusion regarding use Due to the\n",
      "prevalence of American television programs and motion pictures in which the police characters frequently read suspects their rights, it has become an expected element of arrest procedure—in the 2000 Dickerson decision, Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote that Miranda warnings had \"become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture\".\n",
      "While arrests and interrogations can legally occur without the Miranda warning being given, this procedure would generally make the arrestee's pre-Miranda statements inadmissible at trial. (However, pursuant to the plurality opinion in United States v. Patane, physical evidence obtained as a result\n",
      "of pre-Miranda statements may still be admitted. There was no majority opinion of the Court in that case.)\n",
      "In some jurisdictions, a detention differs at law from an arrest, and police are not required to give the Miranda warning until the person is arrested for a crime. In those situations, a person's statements made to police are generally admissible even though the person was not advised of their rights. Similarly, statements made while an arrest is in progress before the Miranda warning was given or completed are also generally admissible.\n",
      "Because Miranda applies only to custodial interrogations, it does not protect detainees\n",
      "from standard booking questions such as name and address. Because it is a protective measure intended to safeguard the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, it does not prevent the police from taking blood without a warrant from persons suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol. (Such evidence may be self-incriminatory, but are not considered statements of self-incrimination.)\n",
      "If an inmate is in jail and invoked Miranda on one case, it is unclear whether this extends to any other cases that they may be charged with while in custody. For example: a subject is arrested, charged with cattle rustling, and is\n",
      "held in county jail awaiting trial. He invoked his Miranda rights on the cow case. While in custody, he is involved in a fight where a staff member loses his ability to walk. He speaks to the custodial staff regarding the fight without staff first invoking Miranda. It is unclear if this statement is admissible because of the original Miranda statement.\n",
      "Many police departments give special training to interrogators with regard to the Miranda warning; specifically, how to influence a suspect's decision to waive the right. For instance, the officer may be required to specifically ask if the rights are understood\n",
      "and if the suspect wishes to talk. The officer is allowed, before asking the suspect a question, to speak at length about evidence collected, witness statements, etc. The officer will then ask if the suspect wishes to talk, and the suspect is then more likely to talk in an attempt to refute the evidence presented. Another tactic commonly taught is never to ask a question; the officer may simply sit the suspect down in an interrogation room, sit across from him and do paperwork, and wait for the suspect to begin talking. These tactics are intended to mitigate the restrictions\n",
      "placed on law officers against compelling a suspect to give evidence, and have stood up in court as valid lawful tactics. Nevertheless, such tactics are condemned by legal rights groups as deceptive. Exemption for interrogations conducted by undercover agents In Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U.S. 292 (1990), the United States Supreme Court held that undercover officers do not have to give suspects a Miranda warning prior to asking questions that may elicit incriminating responses. In this case, an undercover agent posed as an inmate and carried on a 35-minute conversation with another inmate that he suspected of committing a murder\n",
      "that was being investigated. During this conversation, the suspect implicated himself in the murder that the undercover agent was investigating.\n",
      "The Supreme Court came to this conclusion despite the government's admission that a custodial interrogation had been conducted by a government agent. Report of warnings being given to detainees in Afghanistan Beginning in 2009, some detainees captured in Afghanistan have been read their Miranda rights by the FBI, according to Congressman Michael Rogers of Michigan, who claims to have witnessed this himself. According to the Justice Department, \"There has been no policy change nor blanket instruction for FBI agents to Mirandize\n",
      "detainees overseas. While there have been specific cases in which FBI agents have Mirandized suspects overseas at both Bagram and in other situations, in order to preserve the quality of evidence obtained, there has been no overall policy change with respect to detainees.\" Equivalent rights in other countries Whether arising from their constitutions, common law, or statute, many nations recognize a defendant's right to silence. Those rights may be considerably more limited than those available to U.S. criminal defendants under the Miranda ruling.\n"
